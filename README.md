## Description

An app that uses a server in order to store notes that a user inputs. The db.json file fills the role of a database that receives the notes. Users can delete previously added notes too.
My motivation for creating this was to learn more about requests and servers, as well as learning how to use heroku.

## Installation

1: Download repo from github. 2: Save where desired. 3: Open file with a text editor of your choice

For accessing the website rather than the code follow these instructions:

1: Copy link provided in this README

## Usage

Before using ensure that you have node installed.

If running on localhost follow these instructions:

1: Open your integrated terminal in your text editor. 2: type node server, it should run on port 8080. 3: in your browser type in "localhost:8080" this will take you to the homepage. 4: Click "Get started". 5: You can add a new note by clicking the plus, then typing your note on the right, and then clicking the floppy disk icon. 6: To delete, just click on the red bin icon.

If running on heroku click the link provided at the start of this README, then start the above instructions at step 4.
